<p>"Tai-Pan" is a C# project designed to demonstrate my knowledge of:</p>
<ul>
<li>C#</li>
<li>.NET</li>
<li>SQL and SQL Server</li>
<li>Concurrency</li>
<li>Windows Forms</li>

<p>[UML diagram of overall layout - several processes, XML, SQL, database]</p>

<p>A large number of C# processes simulate an economy where various commodities are traded and shipped by freighter between ports across the world. Some of these processes represent "Ports", which broadcast the fluctuating production, consumption and price of various commodoties in their vicinity via XML. Some of these processes represent "Trading Houses", and on the basis of differing price differentials at different ports, they attempt to move goods around the world in the most profitable way possible. These processes also broadcast XML, containing information on their actions.</p>

<p>A foreign exchange process broadcasts information on the fluctuating exchange rate between various currencies.</p>

<p>A "Bank" process listens to these broadcasts, collates the data, and performs inserts and updates on a SQL Server database. This database contains all the information on the current state of the world. The "Trading House" processes have read-only access to the database, and use the information which it contains to make their decisions on the most profitable trade routes.</p>

<p>blah blah concurrency</p>

<p>xxx blah blah test driven development</p>
<p>The whole system is covered by an extensive array of unit tests (xxx say how many, or say what % coverage, and say coverage gradually increasing).</p>

<p>[diagram of database design]</p>

<p>blah blah blah ER design</p>
<p>blah blah blah normal forms</p>
<p>blah blah blah tuning and efficiency and very large tables</p>
<p>blah blah blah triggers, inheritance (whatever correct term is), stored procedures, etc</p>
