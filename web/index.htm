<h2>SQL and Maths and Boats and Stuff</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>"SQL and Maths and Boats and Stuff" is a complex C# project designed to demonstrate my knowledge of:</p>
<ul>
<li>C#</li>
<li>.NET</li>
<li>Concurrency</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Mathematical modelling</li>
<li>Excel integration</li>
<li>Windows Forms</li>
<li>Software Engineering (UML, unit testing, source control, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Outline of project</h3>

<p>[UML diagram of overall layout - several processes, XML, SQL, database, excel spreadsheets]</p>

<p>A large number of C# processes simulate an economy where various commodities are traded and shipped by freighter between ports across the world. Some of these processes represent "Ports", which broadcast the fluctuating production, consumption and price of various commodoties in their vicinity via XML. Some of these processes represent "Trading Houses", and on the basis of differing price differentials at different ports, they attempt to move goods around the world in the most profitable way possible. These processes also broadcast XML, containing information on their actions.</p>

<p>A foreign exchange process broadcasts information on the fluctuating exchange rate between various currencies.</p>

<p>A "Bank" process listens to these broadcasts, collates the data, and performs inserts and updates on a SQL Server database. This database contains all the information on the current state of the world. The "Trading House" processes have read-only access to the database, and use the information which it contains to make their decisions on the most profitable trade routes.</p>

<p>Finally, another process hooks into a running copy of Excel. The current data stream is displayed and updated in one sheet, whilst another sheet can be used to view or edit the data in the database which represents the unfluctuating state of the world.</p>

<p>The whole system is covered by an extensive array of unit tests.</p>
