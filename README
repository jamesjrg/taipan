Tai-Pan

The vast majority of this project is public domain. The project is being written chiefly as a personal learning exercise, and though I very much doubt it has any relevance to anyone else, people are free to make use of the code in their own projects should the desire take them.

The WpfChart program is based on GPL v2 code by Greg Bray (which is in turn based on code by Li Ghao and others).
