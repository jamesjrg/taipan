create db, name TaiPan
edit config file and sql creation scripts with correct username + password (can use same for read and rw if you want)

double click Resolver.rsl

The generate_proxy.bat script can be ignored, it is used to generate AlgoServiceProxy.dll, but a precompiled version is included. I included the script in case it helps someone else do something similar. blah blah
