So, we have tables for:

trading house (id, name, director, balance)

historical data maintained for the balances, somehow

port (id, name, country)
country (id, name, currency, population, corruption level, )

historical data maintained for the above values, somehow

currency (id, name, value [relative to dollar])

historical data maintained for the currency values, somehow

journey (departure_time, arrival_time, departure_port, arrival_port, commodity, quantity
commodity (id, name, description)

some intermediary table linking each port + commodity to a current value in USD
some intermediary table linking each port + commodity to a current stock level
some intermediary table linking each port + commodity to a production level
some intermediary table linking each port + commodity to a current consumption level

historical data maintained for the above four, somehow

freighter_category (id, small, medium, large, ultra-large)
some intermediary table linking each trading house + freighter_category to the number owned

somehow - either via tables or data collation - keep track of
a) turnover of production sector in each country (mining, manufacturing, etc), which is calculated via amount of stuff exported in last week/month/year * (sale price of the stuff exported - cost of that stuff to produce)
b) turnover of service sector in each country (retail, marketing, etc), which is calculated via amount of stuff imported, and also amount of stuff produced for local consumption. higher buy price of imports relative to local buy price reduces turnover.
