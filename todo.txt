git change log:

nowish:
- finish all the spreadsheet sheets filled from database queries. Prices are converted from local currency to historical USD value
- BTree: dump method, unit tests, and delete method
- integration/unit test various main EconomicPlayer classes, inc Bank using [rollback]
- analyse performance and tune
- search for xxx using igrep

////

Process logic and networking:
- currently predictions of f&gw have no relation to what actually happens, maybe they should?
- if a shortage is predicted, it might be wise to buy from a nearby port, not the actual port depending on difference in price and transportation cost
- in server, clients should get removed from clients list if they are disconnected
- net_msg_todo.txt

////

automated testing still todo:

BTree test strategy:
- create a dump method that gives current state of btree as a string, then have assertData method that includes before and after string representations of btree for diff operations with diff values, as well as obviously making sure search method returns correct values, and if a key is deleted then searching for it returns null.

Other unit tests:
- finish unit testing all data structures -still not properly tested are hash table, binary search tree, rb tree, b-tree
- counting sort not yet unit tested (Can't remember why not)
- unittest multihead queue and sync queue
- unittest only bank can write to db
- test: fandandgw should keep track of its last tick time, if current tick time is the same time, skip

Integration tests:
- make processes do right thing when other processes go down, and have automated tests for all possibilities if differing orders of collapse.
- some sort of test that does create db, then start all processes, then run 10 seconds, then bunch of sql queries, then check data is sane
- test that targeted messages are sent only to the correct server/client, and have exact steps to reproduce the test (inc fandgw to trader surplus and shortage)

////

algorithms/data structures stuff:
- switch counting sort to only find max value once, before iterations or timer begin
- do soap methods for manipulating data structures

///

notes:

The name is a nod to book Tai Pan, that is the general point is that there are several large trading houses which ferry various goods very long distances, though actually here the trading houses have been split into two distinct entities, the "Shipping companies" who do the actual transporting of goods, and the "traders" who predict surpluses and shortages in the market and buy and sell goods accordingly.

One day the description here, description in index.htm, description on CV, and description in Wolfie will all need to be synced...

Also make sure names match up UML <-> sql and vice versa

- release.bat - copy across sql scripts, AlgoServiceProxy.dll, dll creation script, Resolve.rsl and associated .pys, README, howtorun, web, wpfchart compiled version and source, precompiled statslib and source, a note on how this is a cut down static sql version without all the c# processes and include fact doc is in web dir
